# Netflix User Reviews Sentiment Analysis

This project focuses on **sentiment analysis** of Netflix user reviews. The main goal is to classify reviews as **positive**, **negative**, or **neutral** using **Natural Language Processing (NLP)** techniques and **machine learning** algorithms.

## Project Overview

The project workflow includes:

1. **Data Collection & Cleaning**  
   Gathering Netflix user reviews and removing noise, missing values, and irrelevant information to prepare a clean dataset.

2. **Data Preprocessing**  
   Text normalization steps such as tokenization, lowercasing, removing stopwords, and stemming/lemmatization to make the data suitable for analysis.

3. **Feature Extraction**  
   Converting text into numerical features using techniques like **TF-IDF** or **Word Embeddings** for model input.

4. **Model Training**  
   Building and training machine learning models (e.g., Logistic Regression, Random Forest, or Neural Networks) to classify sentiment.

5. **Model Evaluation**  
   Assessing model performance using metrics like **accuracy**, **precision**, **recall**, and **F1-score** to ensure reliable predictions.

## Technologies Used

- Python
- Pandas, NumPy
- Scikit-learn
- NLTK / SpaCy
- Matplotlib / Seaborn (for visualizations)

## Outcome

The final model can automatically determine the sentiment of Netflix reviews, providing insights into user opinions and improving understanding of viewer preferences.
